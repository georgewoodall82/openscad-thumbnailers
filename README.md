# Openscad thumbnailers

GTK thumbnailers for .scad, .stl and .3mf files.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This project allows most GTK file managers (Nautilus, Nemo, Caja and PCManFM-gtk) to show thumbnails for `.stl`, `.scad` and `.3mf` files.

It also **works with Nautilus>=3.28**, which introduced thumbnailers sandboxing with bubblewrap.

## Requirements

* openscad
* imagemagick
* Xvfb

In Fedora they can be installed with the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install openscad ImageMagick xorg-x11-server-Xvfb
```

## Installation

To install the thumbnailern a terminal into this directory and execute:

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

After that clean the old thumbnails and restart nautilus

```bash
rm -r ~/.cache/thumbnails
nautilus -q
```
